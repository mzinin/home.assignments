# Task

Keep the following overall goals of the resulting code in mind:
- keep it minimal and simple, but complete enough to be practically useful
- elegant and convenient to use public API
- elegant, readable, and maintainable implementation
- use modern C++ where appropriate (exceptions, templates, STL, etc)
- support both 32 and 64 bit platforms

In other words, you should be able to look at your code 10 years later and still feel proud ;-).

Do not use any external libraries (e.g, Boost, ACE, etc.), except what comes with the standard C++ compiler (STL, iostream, etc) and libc/POSIX. Provide an example and/or a test as well as a way to build everything on a GNU/Linux machine with g++ (preferably makefiles).

# Project

Implement a buffer class that can be used to manage a binary data buffer. It should support copying into/from it, appending, resizing, and getting the underlying buffer as `char*`. The goal is to come up with a functional and clean interface. For example, here is how this buffer class can be used.

```
const char* buf = ...
size_t n = ...
size_t c = ...

buffer b; // Allocate an empty buffer.

b.copy (buf, n); // Copy data into the buffer, growing the underlying
                 // buffer if necessary. After this call b.size () == n.

buffer b1 (n); // Allocate a buffer 'n' bytes long.
memcpy (b1.data (), buf, n);

buffer b2 (0, 1024); // Allocate a buffer 0 bytes long with capacity
                     // to grow without reallocation to 1024 bytes.
b2.size (n);
memcpy (b2.data (), buf, n);

buffer b3 (1024, 5 * 1024); // Allocate a buffer 1024 bytes long with
                            // capacity to grow without reallocation to
                            // 5*1024 bytes.

memset (b3.data (), 0, 1024);

for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
  b3.append (buf, n); // Append the data to the buffer.

if (b3.capacity () < 10 * 1024)
  b3.capacity (10 * 1024); // Make sure the buffer has this capacity.

buffer b4 (buf, n); // Allocate a buffer 'n' bytes long and copy the
                    // data.

buffer b5 (buf, n, 5 * 1024); // Allocate a buffer 'n' bytes long and
                              // with capacity to grow without
                              // reallocation to 5*1024 bytes. Copy
                              // the date over.

buffer b6 (buf, n, n, true); // Assume ownership of the buffer with
                             // size 'n' (second argument) and capacity
                             // 'n' (third argument).
```

Extend this class (or create a new implementation) to support the "multiple underlying buffers" strategy instead of/in addition to "one contiguous underlying buffer" (the idea is to minimize reallocation and copying).
